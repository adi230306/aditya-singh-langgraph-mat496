## Learnings from Module 1 (Lec 1) Simple_graphs.ipynb
- I learnt how to make nodes, edges(as functions) and build a simple graph using StateGraph. I also learnt how too display said graph using in-built functions and how to invoke the graphs
  
- I implemented a simple graph which prints wether I passed my exam or failed it on a 50/50 chance.<img width="275" height="331" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-16 at 7 13 13â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc41058c-6ed4-48b2-8fca-8926a0933529" />
